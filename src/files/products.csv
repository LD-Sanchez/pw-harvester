"The Pool Towel Storage and Spa Robe Tree is designed for hanging towels  spa robes and bathing suits (lower hooks) on the modern outdoor patio. It’s architectural design will make it a focal point for any modern home.The Towel Tree is constructed in the USA using Ipe Wood  the most dense  strong and decay-proof wood known to man. It is extremely heavy  hence high shipping costs  but will likely last 70+ years.The Towel Tree comes in two options: Raw IPE wood and Finished with IPE Oil (additional cost). The raw wood is designed for those who would like to apply their own finish.NOTE. The Towel Tree is shipped in two separate boxes (one for the post and one for the base). It is easily assembled with pre-drilled holes for provided screws that attach the base to the post and pre-threaded hooks that simply thread onto the post.The Towel Tree post is made from solid  dimensional ipe wood lumber. Dimensional ipe wood almost always has “surface checking” which are hairline surface cracks from expansion and contraction of ipe wood in expelling moisture. These are the result of a natural process and are part of the nature of solid  dimensional ipe wood. They have absolutely no impact whatsoever on the strength of the structure of the ipe wood.The Towel Tree can also be used indoors or in a mud room as a coat rack.The base measures 24” square while the height of the Towel Tree is approximately 63”.If you have a jacuzzi or spa  this statement piece is an impressive addition to your setup.Duties  Customs Fees and other taxes are the responsibility of the purchaser. We do not accept returns but please reach out for any issues or concerns"§"https://i.etsystatic.com/23114786/r/il/cfd65a/2921141531/il_340x270.2921141531_d9si.jpg"§"https://www.etsy.com/listing/989501397/spa-robe-tree-and-towel-rack?click_key=4e8771cd7eb9516e2bc2a8b76a0bbc205f5a09f0%3A989501397&click_sum=8babbf48&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=jacuzzi&ref=listing_in_grid-1-3&cns=1"§"
