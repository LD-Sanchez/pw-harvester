Beautiful Turkish Olive Wood infused with White Resin. These make for a beloved gift to any bath tubber / spa lover  house warming gifts  wedding gifts  or anyone really! They look outstanding hanging on the wall or propped up in the bathroom as a piece of decor when not in use."
"
All I need is the dimension of your bathtub in the personalization notes  and any customizations you'd like on your bath tray. "

"
Olive wood is very dense and requires extra care to finish a piece of Olive wood properly. It has absolutely stunning detail and character and well worth the extra time and perfectionism it takes to work this wood into a functional price of art. "
"
This olive wood comes from olive farm which has been passed down through generations of the family. When the tree has passed on due to natural circumstances rather than burning the beautiful olive wood (which is typically what people do  sadly) they have a wood saywer come and harvest it into workable woods for woodworkers like myself. "

The Pool Towel Storage and Spa Robe Tree is designed for hanging towels  spa robes and bathing suits (lower hooks) on the modern outdoor patio. It’s architectural design will make it a focal point for any modern home."
"
The Towel Tree is constructed in the USA using Ipe Wood  the most dense  strong and decay-proof wood known to man. It is extremely heavy  hence high shipping costs  but will likely last 70+ years."
"
The Towel Tree comes in two options: Raw IPE wood and Finished with IPE Oil (additional cost). The raw wood is designed for those who would like to apply their own finish."
"
NOTE. The Towel Tree is shipped in two separate boxes (one for the post and one for the base). It is easily assembled with pre-drilled holes for provided screws that attach the base to the post and pre-threaded hooks that simply thread onto the post."
"
The Towel Tree post is made from solid  dimensional ipe wood lumber. Dimensional ipe wood almost always has “surface checking” which are hairline surface cracks from expansion and contraction of ipe wood in expelling moisture. These are the result of a natural process and are part of the nature of solid  dimensional ipe wood. They have absolutely no impact whatsoever on the strength of the structure of the ipe wood."
"
The Towel Tree can also be used indoors or in a mud room as a coat rack."
"
The base measures 24” square while the height of the Towel Tree is approximately 63”."
"
If you have a jacuzzi or spa  this statement piece is an impressive addition to your setup."
